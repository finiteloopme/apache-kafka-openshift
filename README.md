# Getting started with Apache Kafka on OpenShift
A simple _how to_ guide for deployment of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) ("Kafka") on Red Hat OpenShift.  

This guide aims to provide a basic view on:
1. What is Kafka?
2. Deploying stateless Kafka workload on [OpenShift]^1
3. Deploying statefull Kafka workload on OpenShift
This article is not meant to be a comprehensive guide but should serve as a good starting point for deploying Kafka on OpenShift.

Aim of this guide is to get the audience from starting simple (stateless) Kafka workload to a persistent (statefull) deployment on [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/index.html) ("OpenShift").
